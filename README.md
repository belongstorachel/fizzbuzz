# FizzBuzz without If or Else

I watched the talk 
[RailsConf 2015 - Nothing is Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29MAL8pJImQ) by Sandi Metz, where she talks about Smalltalk and how everything is sent through messages to objects. She showed an example of how to open up the Object, NilClass, and FalseClass classes to enable one to not use the **if** or **else** keywords. What better way to be challenged than to use FizzBuzz without using **if**,**else**, or **case**. :D


### What is the FizzBuzz problem?

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
> But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the
> number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For
> numbers which are multiples of both three and five
> print “FizzBuzz”.
